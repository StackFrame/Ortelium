Installation under Windows
==========================

Quickstart
==========

Check the prerequisites section of the INSTALL file, then come back
here.

We have supplied pre-built JAR (Java ARchive) files of OpenMap, but
you will still need to edit the `openmap.bat' file in the bin/
subdirectory to get OpenMap to run.

	* Load the openmap.bat file in your favorite editor.

	* Change the path to the Java VM to match your
	  local configuration.

	* Change the path to OpenMap to match your configuration.

	* Run the batch file.

Compilation
===========

You may want to build OpenMap from the source code yourself.  OpenMap includes
Ant, the Java-based build tool from Apache, available at
http://ant.apache.org

If you'd like to build OpenMap using Ant, you'll need to:

	1. Edit the ANT_ENV.BAT batch file in the OpenMap distribution:
		- Set your OPENMAP_HOME variable to point to your 
			OpenMap directory.
		- Set your JAVA_HOME variable to point to your Java 
		  distribution.

	2. Open an MS-DOS window and right-click on it to access the 
	   properties. Set Memory -> Initial Environment to a value of at 
	   least 768 or you'll see "Out of environment space" errors when you
	   run Ant.

	3. Close and re-open the MS-DOS window to gain the benefit of the 
	   updated initial environment settings.

	4. Run the ANT_ENV.bat file to set your path and environment variables
	   correctly.
	
	5. Run "ant" from the top level of the OpenMap distribution to 
	   recompile the jar files.  Run "ant clean" to clean out the
	   directories, analogous to "make clean".

Another possibility for recompiling under Windows is using the Cygwin toolkit,
available from http://www.cygwin.com.  This provides you with a Unix-like 
shell, but isn't as simple to use as Ant.
