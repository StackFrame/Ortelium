OpenMap(tm)

What is it?
-----------
OpenMap is a Java Beans based toolkit for building applications and
applets needing geographic information.  Using OpenMap components, you
can access data from legacy applications, in-place, in a distributed
setting. At its core, OpenMap is a set of Swing components that
understand geographic coordinates. These components help you show map
data, and help you handle user input events to manipulate that data.


What are the license terms for using OpenMap?
---------------------------------------------
Take a look at the file called LICENSE in the distribution. We want
you to be able to do pretty much anything with it as long as we get
credit for our work and as long as you offer your changes to us so we
can possibly add them to the standard version we distribute.


OpenMap is a trademark
----------------------
OpenMap is a trademark of BBN Corporation. Just so you're not
confused, BBN Corporation is the legal entity, but we're actually part
of Verizon Communications.  Technically, we do business as "BBN Technologies,
a part of Verizon".

Downloads and home page

Where to start?
------------------------

- OpenMap Viewer

The com/bbn/openmap/app/OpenMap.java example is the default "face" of
OpenMap.  While it looks like a complex example to start with, it's
really a simple framework that uses the MapHandler to add and connect
the OpenMap components.  See the viewer User's Guide
(http://openmap.bbn.com/doc/user-guide.html) for more information.

You can write your own components that can display your data in the
OpenMap Viewer.  Once you've written the layer or plugin, all you need
to do is to add a reference to it in your openmap.properties file.
The OpenMap Viewer reads this file to get configuration information.
The properties file has instructions for adding layers and plugins to
the application.

Likewise, you can change the look of the application by modifying the
openmap.components property in the openmap.properties file.  There are
instructions in the properties file for modifying this property, but
the main point is that changing the application does not require a
code change.  The components are defined in the openmap.properties
file and are connected at runtime.

- SimpleMap

This class is a very simple example that shows how you use the MapBean and a
layer which shows a map of the world.  This
com/bbn/openmap/examples/simple/SimpleMap.java uses the MapBean to
create a static political map in a window with these steps:

       1. Create a JFrame window.
       2. Create a MapBean.
       3. Create the Political boundary Layer
       4. Add the Layer to the MapBean.
       5. Add the MapBean to the ContentPane of the JFrame.
       6. Show the JFrame window.

- SimpleMap2

This com/bbn/openmap/examples/simple/SimpleMap2.java example is a
little more complicated than the previous one, but is more usable.  It
shows the same political layer along with a background graticule layer
(com/bbn/openmap/layer/GraticuleLayer.java) and a simpleforeground
layer (com/bbn/openmap/examples/simple/RouteLayer.java) which shows
hypothetical transportation routes.  This RouteLayer is a good example
of how to extend the Layer class to create your own Layer (More about
this can be found in the architecture documentation at
http://openmap.bbn/doc/openmap-arch.html).

This example program also includes OpenMap GUI widgets for navigating
around on the Map.  The steps involved in creating the program are:

       1. Create a JFrame window.
       2. Create a MapBean.
       3. Set the center and scale of the MapBean.
       4. Create the Political, Graticule, and Route layers.
       5. Add the layers to the MapBean.
       6. Create GUI widgets.
       7. Add the GUI widgets to the ContentPane of the JFrame.
       8. Add the MapBean to the ContentPane of the JFrame.
       9. Show the JFrame window.

Since the MapBean is a PanListener and ZoomListener, you can create an
object that produces these events and hook it up to the MapBean in
order to "drive" the map.  The ToolPanel object generates PanEvents
and ZoomEvents which are used to control the MapBean.

- HelloWorld

The com/bbn/openmap/examples/hello/HelloWorld.java example extends the
ideas developed in the SimpleMap2 example.  It again uses the MapBean
to show a political map of the world, but this time with a blazing
"Hello World!" painted over the map.  It also incorporates Mouse
events to allow point-and-click navigation.

The openmap.properties file
------------------------

The OpenMap application is configured at runtime by the contents of
the openmap.properties file. The openmap.properties file is located in
the openmap directory, and has guidance inside it on how to modify
various properties to change a) what components are part of the
OpenMap application, including what layers are available, b) how those
components are configured, and c) the initial map projection used by
the application.

When the OpenMap application starts up, the PropertyHandler object
checks the CLASSPATH to find an openmap.properties file, and then
checks the user's home directory for one. If an openmap.properties
file was found in the home directory, all of its properties get added
to any properties created previously from a CLASSPATH
openmap.properties file. If there are duplicate properties, the last
version read (from the home directory) will be the version used.

By default, there is an openmap.properties file located at the top
level of the openmap.jar file. When the jar file is created, the
openmap.properties file located in the top level openmap directory
gets copied to the classes/openmap directory, and then included into
the openmap.jar file.

If you make modifications to the openmap.properties file, those
changes will not be reflected in the application unless:

1. The top level openmap directory is included in the CLASSPATH of the
   OpenMap application. This can be done by modifying the openmap
   startup scripts located in the bin directory.

2. The openmap.properties file is copied into your home directory. For
   unix users, this directory is usually /home/<username>. For Mac OS
   X users, this directory is /Users/<username>. For Windows users,
   this directory is D:\Documents and Settings\<username>, where D: is
   the disk windows is installed on. If you are not sure where your
   home directory is, you can compile this code into a HomeDir.java
   file and run it:

 public class HomeDir {
 	public static void main(String[] argv) {
 		System.out.println("User home directory is " +
 			System.getProperties().getProperty("user.home"));
 	}
 }

3. You put the openmap.properties file in the top level of the
   openmap.jar file, either by a) recompiling the openmap code, or b)
   unpacking the jar file, replacing the openmap.properties file, and
   repacking the jar file.

The second option is usually the easiest, but your needs may require
one of the other options.

Please help out!
----------------
There's much room for improvement of the OpenMap sources.  We are
