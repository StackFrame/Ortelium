The OpenMap ext directory is for holding third-party libraries that are needed
for OpenMap to completely build from scratch.  This directory will not be 
provided in the general release of OpenMap, but will be available in the 
repository just to make it easier to check out and build OpenMap.

The packages provided here are:

- Batik 1.7, for the svg code directory
- j3d 1.5.2, for the j3d code directory
- jai 1.1.3, for the geotiff code in the openmap code directory
- JUnit 4.6, for unit tests throughout the code.

To be added:s
- Tomcat server jar for the vpf servlet code.
- cspec.jar, OpenMap build of corba classes generated from idl files.
