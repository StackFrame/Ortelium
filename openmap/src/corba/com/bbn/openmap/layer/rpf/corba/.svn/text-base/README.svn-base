This directory provides the classes needed for a Corba rpf
client-server interface.

You'll need to update the Makefile to set the location of the Corba
jar files.

bootclasspath needs to be set so that corba implementations other than
the one included in hte jdk will be used.  Setting the bootclasspath
puts the corba classes in from of Sun's corba classes in your
classpath.

To compile the idl and the stub classes, do 'make idl', and then
include the resulting rpfserver.jar in your classpath.
