<body>

The Pilot PlugIn package is a demonstration of how to use the Java 3D
package within OpenMap - specifically, the ControlledManager viewer
class. <P>

The package consists of a PilotPlugIn, which is a PlugIn that accepts
graphics from another object, called the PilotLoader.  The PilotLoader
is an object with a timer that manages these location objects called
Pilots (and by extension, PilotPaths).  As the timer runs, the
PilotPaths adjust the Pilot's location on the map.  <P>

For the Java 3D demonstration, the PilotPaths can also launch a Java 3D
viewer window which shows the view from the Pilot point in 3D space.
As the timer runs, the 3D view changes in the viewer. <P>

There are still some issues to be worked out in all of this.
