<body>

The com.bbn.openmap.tools.j3d package holds components that can create
a 3D scene, with a viewer, from OpenMap maps.  The Java3D package,
distributed separately and requiring it's own installation, is
required for all classes in this package. <P>

The Manager classes create the 3D scene, setting up the camera
(Viewing Platform), universe, and all the BranchGroups containing map
information.  The MapContentManager is the basic manager, providing a
view that can be controlled with keyboard strokes.  The
ControlledManager is an extended manager class, which provides a
viewer controlled by external code. <P>

All Managers need a content mask - and each decided what content to
add based on the settings in the mask.  For this initial release, the
3D scene can be created from OpenMap components in a couple of
different ways: <P>

<UL>
<LI> OM3DConstants.CONTENT_MASK_OMGRAPHICHANDLERLAYERS - The manager
will use a MapContent object that uses
com.bbn.openmap.layers.OMGraphicHandlerLayers to get OMGraphics to
convert to Shape3D objects.
<LI> OM3DConstants.CONTENT_MASK_OM3DGRAPHICHANDLERS - The manager will
will use a MapContent object that contacts OM3DGraphicHandler objects,
to let them know what MapContent object they should add scene objects
to.  They have different options for doing this.
<LI> OM3DConstants.CONTENT_MASK_IMAGEMAP - The manager will take all
the layers and paint themselves into an image to be used as a texture
for a flat plane.  This is not entirely implemented yet.
<LI> OM3DConstants.CONTENT_MASK_ELEVATIONMAP - The manager will use a
DTEDFrameCache to create an OMGrid object to use to build a terrain,
and then fill the terrain with whatever is painted on the map.  This
is also not implemented, yet.
</UL>

<P>Thanks to the guys at j3d.org (Justin Couch) for all their work in creating a
great informational site, and for putting code examples up.  There is
a lot if their code sprinkled around in this package.
