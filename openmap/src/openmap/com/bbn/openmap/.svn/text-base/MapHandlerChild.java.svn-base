/**
 * MapHandlerChild shows you all the methods you need to add to an object for it
 * be a good member of the MapHandler. The MapHandler is actually a BeanContext
 * object, which is simply a container for a bunch of objects that may be
 * interested in other objects. If you are using this object as a model to
 * figure out what methods to add to other objects, there are a couple of things
 * to notice. First, java.awt.Components already have a PropertyChangeSupport
 * object in it, so you don't need to implement the methods that deal with
 * property changes. For javax.swing.JComponents, they have
 * VetoablePropertySupport build in, but that object doesn't handle certain
 * methods needed by the BeanContextChild, most notably the
 * (add/remove)VetoableChangeListener() methods with a specific property as an
 * argument.
 * <P>
 * 
 * When you design a MapHandlerChild, you should make it comfortable running
 * without references to objects it depends on. It should wait patiently for the
 * other objects to be added to the MapHandler, and then do the work itself to
 * hook up. It should also listen for those objects to be removed from the
 * MapHandler, disengage gracefully, and wait patiently until it finds something
 * else to hook up to.
 * <P>
 * 
 * An object does not have to be a MapHandlerChild to be added to the
 * MapHandler, but it does need to be one to be able to use it. If you use the
 * findAndInit(Iterator) method to look for objects, you'll find it is called on
 * two different conditions. It's called when this MapHandlerChild is added to
 * the MapHandler, and it then receives a list of all the objects currently
 * contained in the MapHandler. It is also called when other objects are added
 * to the MapHandler. The list then contains objects that have just been added.
 * The findAndInit(Object) method has been added to allow subclassed objects to
 * call super.findAndInit(Object) to let the super classes handles the objects
 * they care about.
 * <P>
 * 
 * When objects are removed from the BeanContext, the childrenRemoved() method
 * is called with a list of objects being removed. Likewise, the
 * findAndUndo(Object) method has been added for the benefit of subclasses.
 * <P>
 * 
 * MapHandlerChild objects expect to be added to only one BeanContext. The
 * BeanContextChildSupport object detects when it has a different BeanContext
 * added to it, and it will fire property change notifications to get itself
 * removed from the first BeanContext.
