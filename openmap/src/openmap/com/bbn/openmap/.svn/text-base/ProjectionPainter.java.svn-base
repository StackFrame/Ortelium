/**
 * The ProjectionPainter interface is intended for objects that can
 * manage graphics and draw them into a Java Graphics object. The idea
 * is that the ProjectionPainter, all within one thread, gathers the
 * graphics that reside within the projection, and render them into
 * the Graphics that has been set up for that projection. The height
 * and width of the projection should match the Graphics height and
 * width, in case some of the graphics from the ProjectionPainter
 * depend on them to place themselves within the Graphics.
 * <P>
 * This is different from the usual paradigm of OpenMap components.
 * Since OpenMap components are Swing components, they usually ready
 * themselves, call repaint() on themselves, and then wait for the
 * Swing thread to call paint and supply a Graphics object. This leads
 * to uncertainty as to when the painting is actually completed, which
 * can be an issue if you are trying to create an image, or something
 * like that.
 * <P>
 * Some layers kick off a SwingWorker thread to do the work. If a
 * layer is modified to implement this interface, the layer should do
 * all the graphics collection work and rendering in the calling
 * thread, so the caller knows that the contribution to the map from
 * this ProjectionPainter is complete.
