
This directory contains a sample implementation of the 
com.bbn.openmap.tools.beanbox.BeanBox class as well as an example OpenMap layer
that uses this sample implementation.

To run the application, use the beanbox.bat file (or beanbox on cygwin).
This will bring up the standard OpenMap frame that contains one additional
component in the form of a blue bean button on the far right side of the 
components toolbar.

Clicking on this button should bring up the Bean Box frame 
that contains three tabs: Generic, Container and Military, 
each containing a single example bean. The configuration of the Bean Box
is specified in the openmap.properties file contained in this package. The
openmap.properties file also contains the following three components necessary
for the drag-n-drop bean package to work correctly:

dropSupport.class=com.bbn.openmap.tools.dnd.DropListenerSupport
dndCatcher.class=com.bbn.openmap.tools.beanbox.BeanBoxDnDCatcher
beanpanel.class=com.bbn.openmap.tools.beanbox.BeanPanel


The manifest.txt file contained in this package contains the statements 
that declares the beans in this package. 
This file is compiled into the openmap.jar.

Example Usage:

1. Run beanbox.bat or beanbox to bring up the OpenMap frame and click on
   the blue bean icon on the component bar to bring up the Bean Box frame.
   Switch to the OpenMap Gestures mode.

2. In the Bean Box frame, switch to the Military tab and drag two fighter 
   beans from the Bean Box to the map.
   NOTE: When you drag and drop a bean on the map, a menu will open
   listing the layers willing to accept the drop event. In this example
   only the SimpleBeanLayer accepts bean drop events. So select this layer
   in the menu.
   A property sheet for the bean will now open giving you a chance to change
   the bean's properties *before* it is added to the layer. Once this sheet
   is closed the bean appears on the layer. You can always change a bean's 
   properties at any time by right-clicking on the bean icon on the layer.

3. In the Bean Box frame, switch to the container tab and drag a container bean 
   from the Bean Box to the map.

4. Drag the two fighter beans on the map into the container bean.

4. Right click on the container bean to bring up its property sheet. (If 
   the propertysheet does not open, try dragging the bean a little bit on the
   map and then right-click on it again.)

5. The default layoutClass for the container is the NullLayout, which
   is as good as not having a layout manager. Change the layoutClass property's
   value to WallFormationLayout. The two fighter beans will get rearranged into
   a wall formation. Dismiss the container's property sheet.

6. Drag another fighter bean from the Bean Box into the container bean
   on the map. The three fighters in the container now get re-layed out in 
   a 3-ship wall formation.

7. Once again right-click on the container to bring up its property sheet.

8. Click on the property editor for the layoutmanager property and adjust the 
   parameters of the WallFormationLayout, namely bearingInDeg and separationInNM
   and watch the effect of these changes on the aircraft formation inside 
   the container. Close all property sheets.

9. Drag the container to a different location and notice how the 3-ship
   formation moves with it.

10.Drag one of the fighters out of the container. This fighter is now no longer 
   a part of the container. The container now rearranges into a 2-ship formation.
