# WHAT IS THIS FILE?
#
# This is a generic OpenMap properties file, which controls how
# components are loaded into the OpenMap application.  It specifies
# the initial projection the map should have when OpenMap is started,
# the layers that should be available, which ones should be turned on,
# and lets you adjust all the layers' attributes for their startup
# configuration.  Most importantly, this file also lets you add and
# remove different components from the application itself.  You can
# modify it with any text editor you like.
#
# WHAT ARE PROPERTIES?
# 
# Java properties are a set of key=value pairs.  The key is the name
# of the thing you are setting, and the value is what you are setting
# it to.  There are a couple of things to look for that we do with key
# values in this properties file.
#
# First, all the properties that can be set for a component are
# *hopefully* listed in the Javadocs (Java API documentation).  If a
# component is specified as a com.bbn.openmap.PropertyConsumer, it
# will be given a change to configure itself based on the settings
# within the properties file.  Components can be layers or any other
# part of the OpenMap application.
#
# Secondly, the keys are scoped to focus the value to a specific
# instance of a components.  If there are more that one layer of a
# specific type (say, two ShapeLayers, one for roads and one for
# rivers), the names of they keys will have a different prefix for the
# key.  For instance, ShapeLayers have a lineColor attribute you can
# set in this file, and the value used is a hexidecimal value for an
# ARGB color (transparency (A), red (R), green (G), blue (B)):
# 
# For a red, non-transparent color for the line.
# lineColor=FFFF0000
# 
# But there are two layers - to scope the property for different
# layers, a prefix must be added to the property, separated by a '.':
#
# roads.lineColor=FFFF0000
# rivers.lineColor=FF0000FF
#
# In this case, the roads layer has a red line color and the rivers
# layer has a blue line color.  The prefix 'roads' and 'rivers' is
# something picked to your liking and used only within this property
# file, and is referred to in OpenMap documentation as a marker name.
# Marker names are first used in a list - the openmap.layers property
# is a perfect example:
#
# openmap.layers=first second third
#
# In this example, I've chosen first, second and third to be marker
# names of three different layers.  Later in the properties file, I
# would use these marker names to define the layers and each layer's
# attributes.  For the 'first' layer, I'll define a ShapeLayer:
#
# # All layers require a class name that defines which one to use
# first.class=com.bbn.openmap.layer.shape.ShapeLayer
#
# # And a pretty name to use in the GUI
# first.prettyName=Roads
#
# # Now come properties that are particular to ShapeLayers:
#
# # These first two are mandatory for the ShapeLayer:
# first.shapeFile=<path to shape file (.shp)>
# first.spatialIndex=<path to spatial index file (.ssx)>
#
# # These are optional, and override the defaults set in the ShapeLayer:
# first.lineColor=FFFF0000
# first.lineWidth=2
#
# You do this for each layer listed.  To add a layer to the
# application, you make up a marker name, add it to the list, and then
# define a set of properties for it using the marker name as a prefix.
#

# This marker name list paradigm is used throughout the properties
# file.  It's an important concept to understand before modifying this
# file.
#
# HOW MANY PROPERTIES FILES ARE THERE?
#
# OpenMap looks for this file in several different places.  When it
# finds one, it loads all the properties, and moves on.  If two
# properties have the same key, the last version read wins.  The most
# important place to keep a version of the openmap.properties file is
# a personalized one in your home directory or profile directory.
# This is the last one read.  It also lets you personalize your
# application setup and not affect anyone else using the OpenMap
# installation.
#
# OK, lets define the map!

# How to lauch a browser to display additional information.

# OpenMap has a Debug messaging mechanism that lets you set certain
# keywords as environment variables (-Ddebug.keyword) to enable
# printouts from different objects.  The code contains these keywords,
# and by looking at a classes' code, you can figure out what the
# keywords are (look for Debug.message("keyword", "message") and 'if
# (Debug.debugging("keyword")' statements).  You can enable these
# messages by putting those keywords in a space-separated list in this
# property.  If you don't want extra messages, you can ignore this
# property and leave it empty.

# You may be trying to run OpenMap as an applet, with the data files
# in their own jar file.  It's difficult to get the applet to look in
# a data jar file if there are no classes in it (I couldn't find a
# solution to this).  So, OpenMap now has a workaround.  You can use
# the com.bbn.openmap.io.AppletDataNugget class to create a
# package-less, empty class to put at the root of your data jar file
# (JavaDocs contains instructions, and there is a usage statement
# printout if you run the class).  It might be good practice to name
# this class the same name as the jar file itself.  Put the name of
# the class (or classes) that is in the data jar file in this list,
# and the BinaryFile will be able to find it.  If you aren't running
# as an applet, or your data is not in a jar file by itself, you don't
# need to use this property.

# These properties define the general components to use in the
# application, OTHER than layers.  Notice the marker name list.  You
# can add and removed parts of the application here, simply by
# adjusting this marker name list and adding properties for that
# marker name.  Note the order in which menu objects are important,
# except helpMenu which is always adjusted to be the last menu item.
#
# If you want to remove components from the application, simply remove
# the marker name from the openmap.components list.  You don't have to
# delete the class definition property, too.  If you want to add a
# component to the list, add the marker name to the openmap.components
# list when you want it to be created and added relative to the other
# components, and then add a 'marker name'.class property for that
# component to this file.
