/**
 * The Link object is the main mechanism for communications between a
 * LinkClient (most likely a LinkLayer) and a LinkServer. This class
 * should only be used directly by a server - clients should use the
 * ClientLink object. This object defines the communications that
 * either side can make.
 * <P>
 * 
 * The ClientLink adds some control methods that the client should
 * use. The client needs to make sure that several queries are not
 * sent to the server at the same time. The ClientLink contains a lock
 * that can be checked, and set. It is up to the client to manage the
 * lock. The ClientLink also provides the method to close the link
 * down, since it makes that decision. The server should remain
 * connected until the client is finished. The server can request to
 * be disconnected, however, and the ClientLink provides a method for
 * the client to check if that request has been made.
