/**
 * Base class implementation of OpenMap OMGeometry, the super class for all
 * OMGraphics.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The geometry classes are intended to pull the object location data out of the
 * OMGraphics. If you have a bunch of OMGraphics that are all rendered with
 * common attributes, you can create a bunch of OMGeometry objects to plavce in
 * a OMGeometryList that will render them all alike.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The BasicGeometry can hold attributes. Traditionally, there has been an
 * appObject (Application Object) that could be set in the OMGeometry/OMGraphic
 * to maintain a pointer for additional information about the shape. This has
 * been modified so that an attribute Map can be maintained for the
 * BasicGeometry to let it hold on to a bunch of organized attributes. To
 * maintain backward compatibility, the setAppObject() and getAppObject()
 * methods have been modified to manage a java.util.Map along with any Objects
 * stored in the appObject. Using the setAppObject() and getAppObject() methods
 * in conjunction with other attributes will cause that object to be stored in
 * the attribute Map under the APP_OBJECT_KEY Map key.
