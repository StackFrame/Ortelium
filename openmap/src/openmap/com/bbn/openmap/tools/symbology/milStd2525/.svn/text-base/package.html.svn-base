<body>

This package provides a way to create MIL-STD-2525B compliant symbols.
The SymbolChooser class provides a GUI to selecting icons, and can be
run in standalone mode to figure out a symbol code to use for the
SymbolReferenceLibrary.<P>

The SymbolReferenceLibrary is the main class to use to create images,
though.  It parses the hierarchy.properties file to create the
symbology tree, and parses the positions.properties file to create a
different tree for understanding the significance of different
positions in the symbol code.  The SymbolReferenceLibrary use
SymbolImageMakers to create the icon based on a symbol code. <P>

Not all symbols have been implemented, we hope to add to them over
time.  The SymbolChooser lets you wander through the tree to find the
icon that suites your need.  We're including a set of 100x100 pixel
GIF icons that can be used with the GIFSymbolImageMaker.  DISA makes a set of SVG
files  that can also be used by people who meet their distribution
criteria.  You'll need the Batik package
(http://xml.apache.org/batik) jar files in your classpath to be able
to use these files, in addition to the omsvg.jar file from the
OpenMap package.  In addition, the DISA symbol files come in a large
directory tree, and for use with the OpenMap code, they need to be
reorganized so that all of the .svg files are in one directory or in
the top level of a jar file.  The SVGSymbolImageMaker can be used
with those .svg files.
